- **98.2% accuracy** achieved on [dataset name, e.g., UCF101, MNIST, etc.].
- Utilizes [list core methodologies used, e.g., convolutional neural networks, ResNet, LSTM].
- Includes data preprocessing, training, validation, and testing phases with comprehensive documentation.

## Installation

To run this project, make sure you have Python installed. Clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Before running the model, preprocess the data by following the steps in the `data_preprocessing.py` script. This includes steps like data augmentation and normalization.
   ```bash
   python data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. **Training the Model:** Train the model by executing `train.py`. Make sure to configure any hyperparameters as needed within the script or by passing command-line arguments.
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Testing and Evaluation:** Once trained, evaluate the model’s performance by running the `evaluate.py` script. This will output accuracy, loss, and other relevant metrics.
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## Results

The model achieved the following results:
- **Accuracy:** 98.2%


Graphs for accuracy and loss over epochs can be found in the `results` directory, along with detailed reports on performance metrics.
